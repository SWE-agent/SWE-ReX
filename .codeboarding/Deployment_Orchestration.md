## Details



The `Deployment Orchestration` subsystem is crucial for managing the lifecycle of SWE-ReX environments across diverse platforms. It provides a unified interface for starting, stopping, and monitoring deployments, while also offering extensibility through a robust hooking mechanism.



### AbstractDeployment

The foundational abstract class for all deployment types. It defines the common interface and lifecycle methods (`start`, `stop`, `is_alive`, `add_hook`) that any SWE-ReX environment deployment must adhere to, ensuring a consistent management contract.

### ConcreteDeploymentClasses

A group of concrete classes (`LocalDeployment`, `DockerDeployment`, `FargateDeployment`, `ModalDeployment`, `RemoteDeployment`, `DummyDeployment`) that extend `AbstractDeployment`. Each class encapsulates the platform-specific logic required to set up, manage, and tear down the SWE-ReX environment on its respective platform. They are the active agents in initiating and controlling the deployed environment.

### DeploymentConfigurationClasses

A collection of data classes (`LocalDeploymentConfig`, `DockerDeploymentConfig`, `FargateDeploymentConfig`, `ModalDeploymentConfig`, `RemoteDeploymentConfig`, `DummyDeploymentConfig`) designed to hold all necessary parameters and settings for a specific deployment type. These classes act as factories, providing methods (e.g., `get_deployment()`) to instantiate the corresponding `ConcreteDeploymentClasses`, thereby effectively decoupling deployment logic from its configuration details.

### DeploymentHooks

This component provides a flexible mechanism to inject custom logic at various stages of the deployment lifecycle. `DeploymentHook` (Abstract): The base interface that all custom deployment hooks must implement. `CombinedDeploymentHook`: A concrete implementation that acts as a composite, holding and executing multiple `DeploymentHook` instances sequentially. `SetStatusDeploymentHook` (Example): A specific concrete hook used to update the status of a deployment.

### AbstractRuntime

The abstract base class for all runtime environments. It defines the common interface for interacting with a deployed SWE-ReX instance, such as executing commands or checking the operational status. It represents the operational interface available *after* a successful deployment.

### ConcreteRuntimeClasses

A group of concrete classes (`LocalRuntime`, `RemoteRuntime`, `DummyRuntime`) that implement the `AbstractRuntime` interface. They provide the actual mechanisms for communication and interaction with the deployed SWE-ReX instances, tailored to the specific environment (e.g., local shell execution, remote API calls).
